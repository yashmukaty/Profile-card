So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

1. Firstly, gave a close look to the design provided. Divided UI design into different components.
2. Set the main/parent div called card which has child classes called card-top for placing top image inside card and card-content for all the hearder and dp
3. A div class class called card-footer for placing values and aliging this using flex, setting flex-direction to column.
4. Providing other styling properties for each class.

I learnt how to use divs and styling components like - flex, transform, position, how to align items, how to handle text font size and color, how to use border and how to play with background - images, url etc.
